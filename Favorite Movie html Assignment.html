	<h1>Why I like this movie</h1>
	
	<p>This movie is an uplifting story with beautiful scenary and great actors and actresses. It takes place in Greece and throughout the whole movie you see beach and old houses that are very authentic. The story is sad at times, but it is also a happy and funny story that they are trying to tell the audience. All the actors and actresses in this movie are very invested in wanting to do a good job in the movie and you can see that clearly after seeing the movie because the quality of acting is very good. I love the songs that they sing in the movie as well. They are very catchy and you can sing along while watching.

	<h2>Favorite actors and actresses and why</h2>
	<p>This movie has one of my favorite actresses, Meryl Streep. It also has one of my favorite actors, Colin Firth. They are both great at what they do because when they act it is very believable and they make you feel like the story is really happening. They are both older actors and actresses, but they both have amazing talent and have been acting for a very long time. Both these actors have been in many movies before this and have a lot of experience. It was great being able to see these two actors together working in the same film.
