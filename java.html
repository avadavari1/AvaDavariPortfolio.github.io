		<h2>Java Content</h2>
		<p>In our Java unit, we coded a game that would be a question and answer format. My game was 
		set in a mall. The user had the choice of going into a pizza shop or ice cream shop. If the
		user chose to go into the ice cream shop they had the option of having either ice cream or a milkshake. 
		Each of the two options had two seperate flavors that you could choose from. Ice cream came with chocolate
		or vanilla and the milkshake came in coffee or strawberry. Once you chose your preference, each flavor came
		with its own topping as well. If you chose to go into the pizza shop, you had the option of staying or leaving
		and being able to choose if you wanted cheese or pepperoni pizza. After you chose your topping the 
		server brought you your food. During the process of coding this game we used if and else if statements to 
		create different possibilities in our game. We also used lists in our code to organize code that is being 
		repeated several times. This method makes it much simpler to organize and have repeating code.</p>
