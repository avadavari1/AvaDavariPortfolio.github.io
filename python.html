		<h2>Unit 1</h2>
		<h2></h2>
		<br>In unit one of Python, our first lab was about trying to write a code that will ask the user for the current year, their name and their age. This would print
		a sentence that states the user's inputs. Additionally, it would ask for the user for two integers and a decimal. This would then print 
		the product of the two integers, product of all three numbers and the remainder of each number divided by two. Overall in this lab,
		we learned how to use variables, methods and classes.</br>

<h2>Unit 2</h2>
<br>In this unit, we used if statements as well as if-else statements and nested if statements. We used these 
codes to prevent the character from walking off the screen, to allow it to jump a certian height before touching 
ground again and to prevent the character from walking through another object.</br>

<h2>Unit 3</h2>
<br>In this lab, we learned about how to use nested loops, using variables and loops to draw multiple 
squares and circles, strings, methods, and how to use loops to repeat code a set of number of times.
We made codes that counted down seconds until it got to and created grass tile to draw the ground
and added rocks that appeared at random points on the screen.</br>

<h2>Unit 4</h2>
<br>In this lab, we learned how to use lists, loops and if statements. In these labs we coded lists to keep 
track of enemies on our game screen and made a program that drew different ground tiles to make a pattern. 
This unit was the hardest because we had to put everything that we learned together to make more difficult
labs in addition to learning the skill of making lists to simplify repeating code.</br>
