		<h2>Scratch Content</h2>
		<h4>Description</h4>
		<li>Use scratch to design and create a program that shows my name.</li>
		<li>The requirements were to add a sprite for each letter in my name and give them 3 unique behaviors.</li>
		<li>The program needed to run the green flag was clicked and for extra credit I added a function to reset that scene to the beginning each time the green flag was clicked.</li>
		
<h4>Concepts Learned</h4>
<ul><li>Using event blocks , green flag clicked, when key pressed</li>
<li>Conditional statements, used if statements to do a motion if statement is true</li>
<li>Used loops, I used a forever block to continue  motion forever</li>
<li>I used a repeat until block to repeat a motion a certain number of times</li>
<li>I used the library of sprites to find letter in my name and adjusted the costumes</li> </ul>

<h4>Description</h4>
	<li>Using scratch to program and design a slideshow, my group and I researched 4 computers and laptops and talked about the specs of each on the slideshow and picked the best computer for our client.</li>
	<li>On scratch we designed the slides to move to th next slide by coding and we also had images that we uploaded for the program.</li>
	<li>We also made a google slide presentation with more detailed information out the computers and laptops that we researched and gave reasons for why we chose the certain laptop for our client.</li>
<h4>Concepts Learned</h4>
<ul><li>Learning how to code to change slides when pressing space bar</li>
<li>Making a chart on Scratch to compare information</li>
<li>Uploading images to use on slides</li>
<li>Specs of different computers and laptops</li>

<h4>Description</h4>
<li>Our final project was made on Scratch.</li>
<li>I chose to do a story with sprites.</li>
<li>The theme of my story was the TV series Friends.</li>
<li>I downloaded my own costume sprites and designed the story to look like the real TV show.</li>
<li>I used events, motions, and looks as well as broadcasting in my final project to code my characters so they would talk to each other during the slideshow story.</li>
<li>Meanings of all specs of laptops and computers</li>
<li>Determining how to choose a good laptop or computer for someone's specific needs</li>
