		<h2>Unit 1</h2>
		<h2></h2>
		<br>In this unit, I chose to use the labs fenced in and nets. For fenced in I needed to create a jeroo and make him hop to the bottom of the fenced area. I did not use a jeroo method in this lab. 
For the lab nets, I have to plant flowers on the nets to get rid of the nets then pick up the flower to continue without any nets or flowers. A jeroo method was not used for this lab either only a main method.</br>

<h2>Unit 2</h2>
<br>In this unit, I chose to show the labs water and LED. In the water lab, I coded in java to create a Jeroo that would have a staring point at the top left of the screen and have it plant flowers around the area of water in the island.
I used both a main method to code for this lab and a jeroo method to shorten my repeating code. I made a code that would plant a flower at each point around the water and leaving a space at each corner of the water. For the LED lab I made a jeroo and main method that would make three different 
types of the number 3 using a jeroo to plant flowers at different locations. Below is the screenshot of the lab water and LED.</br>

<h2>Unit 3</h2>
<br>In this unit, I chose to show the labs water and spiral. For water I made a main and jeroo method that together would cause the jeroo to plant flowers along the water on the first and last row of water. I made a squareside, side, and row method under jeroo methods to have the jeroo 
plant flowers along the water. When there was no water, I instructed the jeroo to continue hopping until it found water again. I needed two jeroos for the water lab. For the spiral lab, I made a main and jeroo code that would help with my repeating code. It told the jeroo to spiral around the 
red fences without running into them to get to the center of the spiral where the flower was.</br>

<h2>Unit 4</h2>
<br>In unit 4, I chose to show the labs alley run and recursive box. For alley run, I made a jeroo and main method that would detect when there was a flower in the island among the fences and water so the jeroo was able to pick it. The jeroo ended at the end of the island when all the flowers were
picked. I used jeroo methods such as pickLeft and pickRight so the jeroo was able to detect the flowers around it and pick them. For the lab recursive box I used a simple main method that told the jeroo to begin the jeroo method that I made called method side. The jeroo was instructed to hop and plant flowers
on the edge of the water all across the island.</br>
